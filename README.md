### Welcome to my Data Science with Python Repository :smile:
#### • The aim of this repository is to demonstrate how to use Python in Data Science field :bulb:
#### • There are two folders in this repo,
 
Folder 1 - [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/DataScience_Python/tree/main/PythonFundamentals) 
covers basic programming ideas in Python such as lists, tuples, loops, classes, etc.

Folder 2 - [DS_Projets](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/DataScience_Python/tree/main/DS_Projects)
contains 8 fundamental labs for those who are interested to begin in data science field, and 2 Data Science projects.

• The Projects in Folder 2 are as follows,

Project A - [Understanding Vector Borne-Diseases Caused by Mosquitoes](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/DataScience_Python/blob/main/DS_Projects/Vector_Borne_Diseases_Analysis.ipynb)

Project B - [Diabetes Early-Risk Prediction using Regularized LR project](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/DataScience_Python/blob/main/DS_Projects/Logistic%20Regression%20on%20Diabetes.ipynb)
